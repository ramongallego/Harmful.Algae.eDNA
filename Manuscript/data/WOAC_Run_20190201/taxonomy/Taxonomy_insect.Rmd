This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
# Checking KC's run 

library (tidyverse)
library (insect)
library (seqinr)

ASV <- read_csv("../../Analysis/After_CleanUP/ASV_table_all_together.csv")

Hash <- read_csv("../../Analysis/After_CleanUP/Hash_Key_all_together.csv")

# Also load previous insect results

previous.insect <- read_csv("../../../OA_eDNA/Data/4.Taxonomic_annotation/last.insect.csv")

```

Let's id all new sequences

```{r new hashes}

# Filter new Hashes
Hash %>% 
  filter(!Hash %in% previous.insect$representative) -> new.aditions
# Write a fasta file for Blast
write.fasta(sequences = as.list(new.aditions$Sequence),
            names = as.list(new.aditions$Hash),
            file.out = "New.sequences.fasta")
# Transform it to a DNABIN class for insect 
new.aditions <- char2dna(new.aditions$Sequence)

names (new.aditions) <- Hash %>% 
  filter(!Hash %in% previous.insect$representative) %>% pull(Hash)

new.aditions


```

```{r Classify the hell out of it}

tree_2 <- readRDS("/Users/ramongallego/GoogleDrive/Kelly_Lab/Projects/OA_eDNA/Data/4.Taxonomic_annotation/classifier.rds")

clasif.hases.addittion <- classify(x = new.aditions, 
                                  tree = tree_2,
                                  cores = "autodetect")


```

```{r}
clasif.hases.addittion %>%  
  filter (str_detect(family, "Syngnathidae"))
  filter(class == "Mammalia")
```
Now we will load the full database that has a lot of sequences
```{r merge both insect runs}



previous.insect %>% 
  filter(representative %in% Hash$Hash) %>% 
  bind_rows(clasif.hases.addittion) -> all.taxonomy.Kelly


```

Now we write as an .csv file for Kelly to use this in her decontamination script

```{r write}

all.taxonomy.Kelly %>% 
  write_csv("Taxonomy.WOAC.csv")

```
