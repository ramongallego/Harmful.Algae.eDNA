@article{Cembella2000,
	Abstract = {A suite of biologically active compounds, fast-acting toxins called spirolides, were recently isolated and characterized from shellfish and plankton samples collected from southeastern Nova Scotia, Canada. Circumstantial evidence from natural plankton assemblages has linked spirolides to gonyaulacoid dinoflagellates, particularly athecate cells (GB-42) that are derived from motile stages from this group. After repeated attempts to isolate spirolide-producing taxa from enriched size-fractionated field samples, numerous isolates of potential source organisms, including Alexandrium ostenfeldii (Paulsen) Balech et Tangen, Alexandrium tamarense (Lebour) Balech, Fragilidium subglobosum (von Stosch) Loeblich III, Gonyaulax spinifera (Claparede et Lachmann) Diesing, Protoceratium reticulatum (Claparede et Lachmann) Butschli, and Scrippsiella trochoidea (Stein) Loeblich III were successfully cultured. Among all cultured dinoflagellate species harvested in late exponential growth phase and analyzed for spirolide content, only A. ostenfeldii was found to produce these compounds. Detailed morphological examination of field specimens and cultured cells of A. ostenfeldii by Nomarski and epifluorescence optical microscopy and by scanning electron microscopy showed that in most major aspects specimens from the western Atlantic coast closely resemble this species as described from Scandinavian waters. Key diagnostic features are the globose morphology and the presence of a large kidney-shaped ventral pore at the margin of the first apical (1') plate. Analysis by liquid chromatography with detection by tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) of the spirolides in an isolate from Ship Harbour, Nova Scotia, indicated that only the C/D type was present in significant amounts. The principal spirolide (90{\%} molar), a desmethyl-C derivative (MW 691), was present at a mean concentration of 54 pg cell-1. This profile is consistent with that found in bulk plankton samples collected from the same site, thereby confirming A. ostenfeldii as the primary source of spirolides in this region.},

@article{feely2010,
	Abstract = {Puget Sound is a large estuary complex in the U.S. Pacific Northwest that is home to a diverse and economically important ecosystem threatened by anthropogenic impacts associated with climate change, urbanization, and ocean acidification. While ocean acidification has been studied in oceanic waters, little is known regarding its status in estuaries. Anthropogenically acidified coastal waters upwelling along the western North American continental margin can enter Puget Sound through the Strait of Juan de Fuca. In order to study the combined effects of ocean acidification and other natural and anthropogenic processes on Puget Sound waters, we made the first inorganic carbon measurements in this estuary on two survey cruises in February and August of 2008. Observed pH and aragonite saturation state values in surface and subsurface waters were substantially lower in parts of Puget Sound than would be expected from anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) uptake alone. We estimate that ocean acidification can account for 24-49{\%} of the pH decrease in the deep waters of the Hood Canal sub-basin of Puget Sound relative to estimated pre-industrial values. The remaining change in pH between when seawater enters the sound and when it reaches this deep basin results from remineralization of organic matter due to natural or anthropogenically stimulated respiration processes within Puget Sound. Over time, however, the relative impact of ocean acidification could increase significantly, accounting for 49-82{\%} of the pH decrease in subsurface waters for a doubling of atmospheric CO2. These changes may have profound impacts on the Puget Sound ecosystem over the next several decades. These estimates suggest that the role ocean acidification will play in estuaries may be different from the open ocean. {\textcopyright}2010 .},

	Abstract = {We can recover genetic information from organisms of all kinds using environmental sampling. In recent years, sequencing this environmental DNA (eDNA) has become a tractable means of surveying many species using water, air, or soil samples. The technique is beginning to become a core tool for ecologists, environmental scientists, and biologists of many kinds, but the temporal resolution of eDNA sampling is often unclear, limiting the ecological interpretations of the resulting datasets. Here, in a temporally and spatially replicated field study using ca. 313 bp of eukaryotic COI mtDNA as a marker, we find that nearshore organismal communities are largely consistent across tides. Our findings suggest that nearshore eDNA from both benthic and planktonic taxa tends to be endogenous to the site and water mass sampled, rather than changing with each tidal cycle. However, where physiochemical water mass characteristics change, we find that the relative contributions of a broad range of organisms to eDNA communities shift in concert.},

@article{lapworth2001,
	Abstract = {Extending from an earlier taxonomic survey of Pseudo-nitzschia species occurring in Australian waters 1, phytoplankton samples were collected from Tasmanian, South Australian, Western Australian and Queensland marine and estuarine waters. Single cells of Pseudo-nitzschia spp. were isolated from samples and grown in culture. Using a combination of light microscopy and TEM, cultures were identified and then tested for domoic acid production with ELlSA. In addition, preserved field samples were cleaned and observed using TEM. This study has identified for the first time the presence of Pseudo-nitzschia australis (a known domoic acid- producer) in Tasmanian, Victorian and New South Wales waters. The regular occurrence of P. multiseries in off- shore samples along the New South Wales coast was noted. Other species identified included P. pseudo delicatissima, P. delicatissima, P. pungens, P. fraudulenta, P. subfraudulenta, P. subpacifica, P. heimii and P. lineola. The present survey confirmed earlier results that the dominant bloom-forming species in Australian waters are P. pseudodelicatissima, P. pungens and P. fraudulenta. Preliminary analysis using ELISA has confirmed significant levels of domoic acid in P. australis cultures tested. Of the five P. pseudodelicatissima cultures tested, only one produced detectable levels of domoic acid. No toxin was detected in any of the cultures of P. pungens tested. Efforts to isolate cultures of P. multiseries have thus far been unsuccessful. The regular presence in southern Australian waters of low concentrations of P. australis and P. multiseries highlight the need for phytoplankton and domoic acid shellfish monitoring programs to be set up in marine farm areas.},

@article{Smayda1997,
	Abstract = {From 60 to 80 species of phytoplankton have been reported to be harmful; of these, 90{\%} are flagellates, notably dinoflagellates. The effects of turbulence on harmful algal bloom (HAB) taxa, their photoadaptive strategies, growth rate, and nutrient uptake affinity (K(s)) are considered. Flagellates, including HAB taxa, collectively have a lower nutrient uptake affinity than diatoms. Four major adaptations are suggested to have been evolved to offset the ecological disadvantages of their low nutrient affinity: nutrient retrieval migrations; mixotrophic tendencies; allelelochemically enhanced interspecific competition; and allelopathic, antipredation defense mechanisms. Motility-based behavioral features of flagellates contributing to their blooms include: phototaxis, vertical migration, pattern swimming, and aggregation, which facilitate nutrient retrieval, trace metal detoxification, antipredation, depth-keeping, and turbulence avoidance. Neither a general physiological syndrome nor distinctive physiological profile distinguishes harmful flagellate species from nonharmful taxa. However, HAB flagellates exhibit significant ecophysiological differences when compared to diatoms, including greater biophysically vulnerability to turbulence, greater bloom dependence on water-mass stratification, greater nutritional diversity involving mixotrophic tendencies, greater potential use of allelochemical mechanisms in interspecific competition and antipredation defenses, and unique behavioral consequences of their motility. Flagellates use a 'swim' strategy; diatoms a 'sink' strategy.},

	Abstract = {In September 2004 a large, nearly monospecific diatom bloom of Pseudo-nitzschia cuspidata off the coast of the state of Washington reached cell concentrations of 6.1 × 106 cells L-1 and produced maximum particulate domoic acid (pDA), dissolved domoic acid (dDA), and cellular domoic acid concentrations of 43 nmol L-1, 4 nmol L-1, and 63 pg cell″1, respectively. This bloom co-dominated the phytoplankton assemblage with the euglenoid Eutreptiella sp. in the Juan de Fuca eddy region, a known initiation site for toxigenic Pseudo-nitzschia blooms. Two isolates of P. cuspidata collected during separate cruises produced domoic acid (DA) in culture. During the September 2004 survey, 84{\%} of the stations (n = 98) had detectable Pseudo-nitzschia and 78{\%} had detectable pDA. There were no significant correlations between either pDA or cellular DA and ambient concentrations of macronutrients; however, when considering only those stations where Pseudo-nitzschia was present, pDA was positively correlated with chlorophyll a and negatively correlated with temperature (p ≤ 0.01) at both 1- and 5-m depths. Correlations between cellular DA concentrations and total bacteria or cyanobacteria abundances were not significant. Variable ratios of pDA: dDA in the eddy region suggest that DA release was under cellular regulation by Pseudo-nitzschia. Stations where dissolved Fe concentrations were limiting ({\textless}0.5 nmol L-1) had the highest Pseudo-nitzschia abundances and pDA and cellular DA values. These results provide enticing field evidence of the role of Fe limitation in controlling cellular DA levels. {\textcopyright} 2009, by the American Society of Limnology and Oceanography, Inc.},
